test python code

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print([fibonacci(i) for i in range(10)])
```

And some JavaScript:

```javascript
const posts = await fetch('/api/posts')
  .then(res => res.json())
  .catch(err => console.error('Failed to load posts:', err));

posts.forEach(post => {
  console.log(`${post.title} - ${post.date}`);
});
```

Here's an example of the new quote component:


Here's how a native blockquote looks:

> This is a native blockquote using standard Markdown syntax. It uses the default styling defined in the Layout.astro file with the orange left border and subtle background tint.

> You can also have multi-paragraph blockquotes.
> 
> Like this second paragraph, which continues the same blockquote block.
