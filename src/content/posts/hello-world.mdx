import Quote from '../../components/Quote.astro';


test python code

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print([fibonacci(i) for i in range(10)])
```

And some JavaScript:

```javascript
const posts = await fetch('/api/posts')
  .then(res => res.json())
  .catch(err => console.error('Failed to load posts:', err));

posts.forEach(post => {
  console.log(`${post.title} - ${post.date}`);
});
```

Here's an example of the new quote component:

The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing.
</Quote>

<Quote author="Maya Angelou" source="I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings">
