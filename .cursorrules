# Yang Yu's Dev Blog - Cursor Rules

## Project Overview
This is an Astro-based personal dev blog with minimalist design. Keep the same format and patterns established in the codebase.

## Core Principles
- **Maintain existing format**: Follow the established blog post structure and design patterns
- **Minimalism**: Keep code and features simple and purposeful
- **Consistency**: Use existing patterns in components and layouts

## Blog Post Format

### Content Structure
- Blog posts go in `src/content/posts/` as `.mdx` files
- Use the established frontmatter format:
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: "Post Title"
  description: "Brief description"
  date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
  slug: "/custom-slug" (optional)
  ---
  ```

### Code Style
- Use 2 spaces for indentation (never tabs)
- Follow existing patterns in `src/layouts/Layout.astro` and `src/pages/posts/[id].astro`
- Keep the established color scheme and typography

## Design System
- **Colors**: Warm orange primary (#d97706), cool blue links (#1e40af)
- **Typography**: Georgia serif for body text
- **Layout**: Max-width 750px content area with established padding
- **Code blocks**: Use existing Shiki configuration with copy buttons

## File Organization
- Components: `src/components/` (PascalCase)
- Layouts: `src/layouts/` (PascalCase) 
- Pages: `src/pages/` (follow Astro conventions)
- Blog posts: `src/content/posts/` (kebab-case.mdx)

## When Making Changes
1. Follow existing patterns before creating new ones
2. Keep the minimal aesthetic and clean design
3. Maintain the established blog post format and routing
4. Use component-scoped styles over global CSS
5. Test responsive design on mobile breakpoints

## Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Astro with React integration
- **Package Manager**: Yarn
- **Content**: MDX files in content collections
- **Styling**: Component-scoped CSS with CSS custom properties
